        {
          "question": "How does the C++ formatter work without installing anything?",
          "answer": "The C++ formatter runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. When you paste code, it compiles the clang-format engine to WASM and executes locally—no data leaves your machine. It instantly reformats your source without sending anything to external servers, giving you instant results offline."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my C++ source code private when using this online formatter?",
          "answer": "Yes. Because all formatting is performed client-side, your source code never travels across the internet. Nothing is stored, logged, or shared; even your browser’s localStorage is left untouched. This zero-transfer approach keeps proprietary or sensitive C++ code completely private."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which C++ file extensions and coding styles are supported?",
          "answer": "Drop or paste any C++ translation unit: .cpp, .cxx, .cc plus headers .hpp, .hxx, .hh. The tool recognizes CUDA kernels, Objective-C++ blocks, and Qt macros, applying LLVM, Google, Chromium, Mozilla, WebKit, or Microsoft style presets at the click of a button."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is the browser-based C++ code formatter?",
          "answer": "WebAssembly runs at near-native speed, so formatting a 10 k-line file takes under 100 ms on an average laptop. No network round-trips mean you’ll see the reformatted output faster than most local IDE plug-ins can start up."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I upload my own .clang-format file or customize indentation rules?",
          "answer": "Past the clang-format configuration (indent, column-limit, brace style, etc.) into the “.clang-format” tab, choose “File → Save Settings”, and the tool will store the YAML in your browser cache. Re-visit the page and your custom style automatically reloads."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this formatter compatible with Chromebooks, Linux, macOS and Windows?",
          "answer": "Completely. WebAssembly runs on every modern Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari build—no plug-ins or admin rights required. Offline mode continues to work after the first load, which is handy for air-gapped development environments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are typical workflows for using the C++ code formatter online?",
          "answer": "Most developers paste a messy snippet during pull-request reviews to verify formatting, drop entire folders to normalize legacy code, or integrate the formatter into CI scripts by piping STDIN/STDOUT to the downloadable WASM binary for reproducible builds."

          "question": "Will the online formatter respect my project’s line-length rules?",
          "answer": "Output is identical to what the `dart format` command produces with default line length (80). If your project uses a different `dartfmt` line-length setting, change the slider in the UI; the WASM engine re-wraps accordingly. This keeps the playground consistent with CI pipelines that run `dart format --set-exit-if-changed`."
        },
        {
          "question": "What browsers or operating systems do I need to run this tool?",
          "answer": "The formatter runs in any modern Chromium, Firefox, Safari, or Edge release that supports WebAssembly and ES2020. Because processing is client-side, you can use it offline after the first page load—handy for airplane or secure-air-gapped environments where local tooling is restricted."

Your source stays on your machine, so it works offline and is safe for proprietary scripts, notebooks, or any sensitive .py / .pyw files."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which Python syntax and file extensions does the formatter support?",
          "answer": "It supports every mainstream Python construct up to 3.12 (match, walrus, f-strings with =, typed-params, etc.) and handles both normal scripts (.py) and Windows-no-console scripts (.pyw). It leaves shebangs, encoding cookies, and future-statements untouched so your files remain immediately runnable."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is browser-based Ruff compared to running the CLI locally?",
          "answer": "Because Ruff is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, it typically formats in <50 ms for a few-hundred-line file—within 10-15 % of native speed. Cold-start download of the ~1 MB WASM bundle is a one-time cost; afterwards formatting is instant with no Node, pip, or Rust toolchain installs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I format an entire project or only single files?",
          "answer": "Right now you can drop multiple files or an entire folder; each .py / .pyw is processed individually and downloaded with its original folder structure preserved. Bulk-formatting uses the same default Ruff rules; project-wide pyproject.toml customization is on the roadmap—check the Settings panel for updates."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will the formatter change my code’s AST or introduce runtime differences?",
          "answer": "Never. Ruff is a deterministic, AST-safe formatter; the byte-code before and after remains identical. It only touches whitespace, indentation, blank lines, and optional commas—exactly like `black`, so you can safely run it on legacy or production codebases."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need Python, Node, Docker, or any install to use this tool?",
          "answer": "No installation at all. The only requirement is a modern browser with WebAssembly support (Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 11+, Edge 16+). Open the page, paste or drop your code, and hit Format—works on locked-down corporate laptops, Chromebooks, even tablets."
        },

When you paste YAML code or upload a file, the formatting happens client-side without sending data to external servers. This ensures complete privacy while delivering instant results, making it ideal for sensitive configuration files and developer workflows."
        },

          "question": "Is my YAML data secure when using this formatter?",
          "answer": "Yes, all YAML formatting is performed locally in your browser. Your code never leaves your device, ensuring complete confidentiality for sensitive data like API keys, credentials, and proprietary configurations. This browser-based approach eliminates cloud processing risks and maintains your data security."
        },
        {
          "question": "What YAML file types and features are supported?",
          "answer": "The formatter supports standard YAML files (.yaml, .yml) including complex nested structures, arrays, anchors, aliases, and multi-line strings. It handles YAML 1.2 specification features and preserves comments while maintaining proper indentation and spacing for optimal readability."

        {
          "question": "How fast is the YAML formatting process for large files?",
          "answer": "WebAssembly-powered formatting delivers exceptional performance, processing even large YAML files (10MB+) in milliseconds. Unlike server-based tools, there's no network latency or upload time. The local processing ensures consistent speed regardless of file size, making it perfect for formatting extensive Kubernetes manifests or OpenAPI specifications."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the formatter handle nested structures and complex YAML syntax?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Our formatter handles complex YAML structures including nested mappings, sequences, flow-style notation, and advanced features like merge keys (<<). It correctly preserves special characters, Unicode text, and maintains the semantic meaning of your configuration while creating consistent formatting."

        {
          "question": "Does this YAML formatter work offline for development environments?",
          "answer": "The tool works offline once loaded in your browser, making it perfect for development environments with restricted internet access. Simply bookmark the page or add it to your browser bookmarks bar for instant YAML formatting anywhere, whether you're working in secure corporate networks or remote locations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What formatting standards does the YAML formatter follow and how does it handle errors?",
          "answer": "Our formatter preserves valid YAML while fixing common issues like inconsistent indentation, mixed tabs/spaces, and improper comment placement. It standardizes formatting to 2-space indentation, aligns colons, and maintains proper line breaks. Invalid YAML will show clear error messages with line numbers to help you quickly identify syntax problems."
