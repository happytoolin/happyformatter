          "answer": "Our javascript (biome) minifier processes your code entirely in the browser using WebAssembly technology. This means your code never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security. The minifier applies industry-standard formatting rules to make your code more readable and consistent."

          "question": "Is my JavaScript (Biome) code secure when using this minifier?",
          "answer": "Yes, absolutely! Your JavaScript (Biome) code is processed entirely within your browser using WebAssembly. No code is ever sent to our servers, ensuring your intellectual property and sensitive data remain completely private. We cannot see, store, or access your code in any way."
        },
        {
          "question": "What JavaScript (Biome) file formats are supported?",
          "answer": "Our minifier supports the following JavaScript (Biome) file extensions: js, jsx, mjs. You can either paste your code directly into the editor or upload files with these extensions for formatting."

        {
          "question": "Can I use this JavaScript (Biome) minifier for large projects?",
          "answer": "While our minifier is optimized for performance, it's best suited for individual files or moderate-sized code snippets. For very large projects, we recommend processing files individually or integrating a minifier into your development workflow through IDE extensions or build tools."

          "answer": "Yes! Our JavaScript (Biome) minifier is completely free to use with no limitations. There's no registration required, no premium tiers, and no hidden costs. You can format as much code as you need, whenever you need it."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I customize the JavaScript (Biome) formatting rules?",
          "answer": "Currently, our minifier uses standard formatting rules. However, we're working on adding customizable formatting options in future updates. If you have specific formatting requirements, please let us know through our feedback system."
